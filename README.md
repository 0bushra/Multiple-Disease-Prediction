# Multiple-Disease-Prediction

Health Check Dataset
This dataset is created for the purpose of learning and project development. It aims to predict whether a person has a specific disease or is healthy based on blood samples or parameters. The data has been handcrafted and scaled within the range of 0 to 1.

Parameters
The dataset includes various parameters which are indicative of a person's health status. These parameters have been researched to understand their significance in health diagnostics. Here are some of the parameters included:

Blood Pressure
Cholesterol Levels
Blood Sugar Levels
Body Mass Index (BMI)
Heart Rate
Hemoglobin Levels
Target Variable
The target variable indicates whether a person is diagnosed with a specific disease or is considered healthy. This variable is binary, where 1 represents the presence of the disease and 0 represents good health.

Data Exploration
Before applying machine learning algorithms, it's essential to understand the distribution of parameters and their relationship with the target variable. This dataset facilitates exploring these relationships and understanding the impact of each parameter on health diagnostics.

Machine Learning Models
In this project, three machine learning models have been implemented for predictive analysis:

Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
These models are chosen for their effectiveness in binary classification tasks and their suitability for this dataset.

Project Idea
This dataset and associated machine learning models can be utilized for various purposes, including:

Developing a health diagnosis application
Creating a predictive model for early disease detection
Conducting research on the significance of different health parameters
Usage
Feel free to use this dataset for learning purposes, experimenting with machine learning algorithms, and exploring health diagnostics. However, keep in mind that this dataset is simulated and should not be used for real-world medical diagnostics without proper validation and verification.
